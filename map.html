<!--map.html
    
    Creates a single, self-contained html file for the Google Map used
    in the app.  The google api is not loaded inline and the map is
    placed in the main app window, window.html, using an iframe.  Finally,
    map.html is added to the "sandbox" portion of the app manifest.  All
    of these steps are necessary to comply with the Content Security
    Policy, CSP, of Google Chrome Apps.
